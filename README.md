VIbrational Rotational Gaseous dIatomic anaLysi

This library is intended for the analysis and characterization of simple gaseous diatomic (two molecule) systems. It includes three models (zero, first, and second order approximations) as well as underlying background theory. If you wish to learn about the underlying theory, please see 'theory.pdf' for more details. 

To run example analysis on windows (UNTESTED!):

2. Navigate to this directory by typing what is below and hit enter: 
    cd C:\path\to\rovib-analysis\ 
3. execute by writing the below and hitting enter:
    .\example-analysis.ps1

To run example analysis on UNIX:
1. Open your terminal 
2. Navigate to this directory by typing what is below and hit enter: 
    cd ~/path/to/rovib-analysis 
3. make example-analysis.sh executable by typing the following and hitting enter:
   chmod +x example-analysis.sh
4. run script by typing the following and hitting enter:
