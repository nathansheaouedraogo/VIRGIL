# VIRGIL
VIbrational Rotational Gaseous dIatomic anaLysi

This library is intended for the analysis and characterization of simple gaseous diatomic (two molecule) systems. It includes three models (zero, first, and second order approximations) as well as underlying background theory. If you wish to learn about the underlying theory, please see 'theory.pdf' for more details. 

Will update with more detailed instructions on how to use this module at a later date.
